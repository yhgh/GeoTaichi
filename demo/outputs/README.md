# Demo Outputs

This directory contains ready-to-visualise VTK snapshots and compact SVG
previews generated by `demo/generate_visualizations.py`. When Warp is not
available the script falls back to deterministic stub data, which is what you
will find committed here. Running the script on a machine with Warp installed
will overwrite the files with snapshots from the lightweight regression
scenarios.
